1. Totals are not available for these results due to suppression constraints. More Information:											
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/faq.html#Privacy.

Caveats:											
1. Totals and Percent of Total are disabled when data are grouped by a 113 or 130 Cause List because both aggregate and detailed											
values are displayed in the table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be											
misleading.											
"2. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when Autopsy, Place of Death, Weekday or Month are grouped by or limited,"											
due to lack of a valid population. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#NotApplicableRates.											
"3. As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information:"											
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#2014-Revision.											
4. Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the Place of Death											
"category ""Place of death unknown."" Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More information:"											
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Georgia-Reporting-Anomalies.											
5. Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of											
"death code R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality."" Caution should be used in interpreting these data."

6. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:											
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Assurance of Confidentiality.											
7. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:											
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable.											
"8. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"											
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"

"9. The Place of Death category 'Medical Facility - Status unknown' is only available from 1999 - 2002, and 'Hospice facility' is"											
only available for 2003 and later.											
"10. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"											
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"											
in information available to individual states and probable errors. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More
