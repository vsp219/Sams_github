Caveats:,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when Autopsy, Place of Death, Weekday or Month are grouped by or limited,",,,,,,,,,,,
due to lack of a valid population. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#NotApplicableRates.,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:,,,,,,,,,,,
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable.,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,",,,,,,,,,,,
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:",,,,,,,,,,,
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated.,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the,,,,,,,,,,,
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis",,,,,,,,,,,
of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin,,,,,,,,,,,
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:",,,,,,,,,,,
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Racial Differences.,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. The Place of Death category 'Medical Facility - Status unknown' is only available from 1999 - 2002, and 'Hospice facility' is",,,,,,,,,,,
only available for 2003 and later.,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99",,,,,,,,,,,
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences",,,,,,,,,,,
in information available to individual states and probable errors. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More,,,,,,,,,,,
