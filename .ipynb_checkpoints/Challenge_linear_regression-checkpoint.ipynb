    "Challenge\n",
    "In this module, we learned how to approach and solve regression problems using linear regression models. Throughout the module, you worked on a house price dataset from Kaggle. In this challenge, you will keep working on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario\n",
    "The housing market is one of the most crucial parts of the economy for every country. Purchasing a home is one of the primary ways to build wealth and savings for people. In this respect, predicting prices in the housing market is a very central topic in economic and financial circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The house price dataset from Kaggle includes several features of the houses along with their sale prices at the time they are sold. So far, in this module, you built and implemented some models using this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you are required to improve your model with respect to its prediction performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this challenge, submit a Jupyter notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps\n",
